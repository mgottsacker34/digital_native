# Digital_Native

This project is a web-based portfolio for my English Senior Seminar course on Rhetoric, Writing, and Technology.
Throughout the semester, we studied how attention functions in humans and non-humans. In a series of publications, we pursued questions such as: What is attention? How does it work as a commodity? Is it better understand as a function of environmental factors and actors? How do networks of attention form and operate?

The small size of the class allowed us students to tailor our projects according to our interests. I chose to focus on digital attention, so each project implicates the field of Human Computer Interaction (HCI), even if I didn't realize it at the time. The portfolio is located at [digitalnative.space](http://digitalnative.space). The series of projects can be found in the [Attend section of the website](http://digitalnative.space/html/publications.html).

My last and most interesting (in my opinion, at least) publication examined how humans attend to entirely digital worlds. I created a [web-based mobile Virtual Reality experience](https://digital-calibration.glitch.me) using [Mozilla's A-Frame technology](https://aframe.io). I observed some of my friends using the VR application on their phones in a basic headset. Through this project, I learned that human attention can be affected by VR experiences in serious and complex ways. And we don't understand all of those ways yet.

This portfolio required a lot of HTML/CSS and JavaScript coding. I hosted it on Github.io, so I didn't have to take care of the backend stuff. Admittedly, the repo has a pretty messy commit history because I found myself prototyping and coding very quickly as I ran into configuration issues while trying to meet deadlines.
