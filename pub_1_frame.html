        <h6>Model 1. Threaded.</h6>
        <br>
        <p>This illustration is under construction still.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The initial line represents the user's main thought process.  At that point, there is only one process running.  The user could be in a state of deep attention toward one thing.  However, two more processes start in the background as 'distractions'.  They require attention.  The main process is then split.  The divergence of the main line into three separate paths represents this split.  For the APU, this requires multi-threading.  Each process has access to the same underlying system resources, and each process has a specific start point founded in the original process.  As the processes conclude, the APU must join them together.  The processor returns to a solitary thread, a state of deep attention on one item.</p>
        <br>
        <h6>Model 2. Forked.</h6>
        <br>
        <p>Again, the initial line represents the user's main thought process with one process running.  When a 'distraction' arises that requires the user's attention, the process pauses and runs in the background.  The dashed lines represent this daemon process activity.  The process forks to attend to the 'distraction'.  The forked process spawns an entirely new process.  It does not share the same resources as the original process.  It runs as if it were the only thing on the system.  The pattern repeats when another distracting process begins.  All other processes run in the background, but without conducting any activity.  When a forked process concludes, control of system resources is handed back to the previous process.  The APU must manage the processes' scheduling and resources.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In each case, attention is a mechanism.  It is not a commodity or resource.  On the contrary, it manages other resources.</p>
